# Zerodha_Clone

A web-app clone of the Zerodha trading dashboard — frontend + backend + basic dashboard features.  

## 🔹 Description  
This project replicates key aspects of a stock-trading dashboard inspired by Zerodha: login/authentication, user dashboard, and stock data display. The repo contains three main parts: `frontend`, `backend` and `dashboard`.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- User authentication (login/signup)  
- Responsive dashboard layout (stock list, details, etc.)  
- Separation of frontend and backend for modular development
